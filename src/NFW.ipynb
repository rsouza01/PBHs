    "Here's the idea. We are working on the distribution/number density of primodial black holes right after inflation. So, based on some physical arguments, it's inferred their average masses, etc. What I want is to check if its consistent with cosmic evolution and rotation curves. So, I was thinking, how to follow this evolution from T=end of inflation until present time, like are they there yet, have they already evaporated, what is the number density today? And once I get this, how to fit it into the NFW profile to check wheter they can answer for the galaxy rotation curves or not? Makes sense?\n",

    "\n",
    "The proposed two-step check—cosmological evolution (evaporation, number density) followed by fitting to the NFW profile—is precisely the right approach to test the viability of PBHs as Dark Matter (DM).\n",
    "\n",
    "## I. PBH Cosmological Evolution: $\\mathbf{T \\approx \\text{Inflation End}}$ to $\\mathbf{T_0}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial part of the evolution is determining which PBHs survive until today and what their current number density is, as this links the formation efficiency ($\\beta$) to the present-day density ($\\Omega_{\\text{DM}}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Formation and Mass\n",
    "PBHs form when large density perturbations ($\\delta \\rho / \\rho$) created during inflation re-enter the Hubble horizon, typically during the **Radiation-Domination (RD) era**. The mass of the formed PBH ($M_{\\text{PBH}}$) is roughly proportional to the horizon mass ($M_H$) at the time of collapse, $t_{\\text{coll}}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_{\\text{PBH}} \\approx \\gamma M_H(t_{\\text{coll}}) \\propto T_{\\text{coll}}^{-2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The asteroid-mass range we discussed, $M_{\\text{PBH}} \\in [10^{17}, 10^{23}] \\text{ g}$ (or $\\sim 10^{-16}$ to $10^{-10} M_\\odot$), corresponds to collapse times just after the end of inflation and reheating, well before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN).\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Evaporation (Hawking Radiation)\n",
    "The most critical factor for survival is the PBH lifetime $\\tau_{\\text{evap}}$, which depends on mass $M$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau_{\\text{evap}} \\approx 1.0 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ years} \\left( \\frac{M}{5 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ g}} \\right)^3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Evaporated PBHs:** Any PBH with mass **$M < M_{\\text{crit}} \\approx 5 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ g}$** would have completely evaporated by the present age of the Universe ($\\sim 13.8$ Gyr). These are completely irrelevant for the current Dark Matter mass budget.\n",
    "* **Surviving PBHs:** The entire **asteroid-mass window** ($10^{17} \\text{ g} \\lesssim M$) is safe from complete evaporation. However, lighter PBHs in this range (e.g., $10^{15} \\text{ g} < M < 10^{17} \\text{ g}$) are heavily constrained by the injection of high-energy particles (photons, electrons, positrons, neutrinos) from their *partial* evaporation into the early Universe plasma, which would distort the CMB and alter light element abundances during BBN. This is why the mass window is constrained to the higher end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Evolution of Number Density Today\n",
    "The number density ($n$) scales with the volume, while the mass density ($\\rho$) scales with the energy density of the background fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PBH mass fraction at formation, $\\beta$, is often defined as the mass fraction of PBHs to the total background density ($\\rho_{\\text{tot}}$) at the time of formation, $t_{\\text{coll}}$:\n",

    "$$\\frac{\\rho_{\\text{PBH}}(t)}{\\rho_{\\text{tot}}(t)} \\propto \\frac{a(t)^{-3}}{a(t)^{-4}} \\propto a(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The present-day fractional abundance of DM in PBHs, $\\mathbf{f_{\\text{PBH}}} = \\Omega_{\\text{PBH}} / \\Omega_{\\text{DM}}$, is related to $\\beta$ by:\n",
    "$$f_{\\text{PBH}} = \\frac{\\Omega_{\\text{PBH}}}{\\Omega_{\\text{DM}}} \\approx 10^8 \\frac{\\beta(M)}{1} \\left( \\frac{M}{M_\\odot} \\right)^{-1/2}$$\n",
    "*(This relation is highly model-dependent, relying on the RD epoch prevailing until matter-radiation equality.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the current global number density, $n_0$, required for $f_{\\text{PBH}}=1$:\n",
    "$$n_0 = \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{DM, global}}}{M_{\\text{PBH}}} = \\frac{\\Omega_{\\text{DM}} \\rho_{\\text{crit}}}{M_{\\text{PBH}}}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the average number density globally. The total number of PBHs is conserved over cosmic time (ignoring evaporation for surviving masses), but their **number density scales simply as $n(t) \\propto a(t)^{-3}$**.\n",

    "## II. Consistency Check: Fitting to the NFW Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "The question now becomes: **Can this conserved global population of PBHs naturally assemble into an NFW distribution that solves the rotation curve?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is **Yes, conceptually, but with caveats.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. The NFW Profile Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "The Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile is the end-product of **hierarchical structure formation** under the $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm, assuming the DM fluid is **cold and collisionless**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **PBHs as CDM:** For the asteroid-mass PBHs ($M_{\\text{PBH}} \\lesssim 10^{-10} M_\\odot$), the particle mass is so small relative to the halo mass ($M_{\\text{halo}} \\sim 10^{12} M_\\odot$) and their interactions are so weak that they behave as the required **Cold Dark Matter (CDM) fluid**.\n",
    "* **The Fit:** If PBHs are the sole DM component ($f_{\\text{PBH}}=1$), the global average mass density $\\rho_{\\text{PBH}}$ today is $\\Omega_{\\text{DM}}\\rho_{\\text{crit}}$. Standard N-body simulations, which generate the NFW profile, rely only on this mass density and the assumption of collisionless dynamics. Thus, the local number density $\\mathbf{n_{\\text{PBH}}(r)}$ at any point $r$ in the halo must follow the required NFW mass density profile $\\mathbf{\\rho_{\\text{NFW}}(r)}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{n_{\\text{PBH}}(r) = \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{NFW}}(r)}{M_{\\text{PBH}}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the NFW profile is empirically a good fit to most observed rotation curves, the PBH distribution **is consistent** with answering the galactic rotation curve problem, provided $M_{\\text{PBH}}$ is small enough for them to act as a collisionless fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Caveats and Tensions (The \"Consistency Check\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The true consistency check comes from the potential *deviations* of PBHs from a perfect, smooth CDM fluid:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Mini-Halos (Small-Scale Clumpiness):** The PBHs form *before* matter-radiation equality, and they act as matter from their time of formation. If the PBH density perturbations are large enough, they can rapidly collapse into dense **PBH mini-halos** at $z \\gg 100$.\n",
    "    * **The Issue:** The subsequent mergers and infall of these mini-halos into the galaxy could lead to a **clumpier** dark matter distribution than the smooth NFW profile, particularly affecting the density substructure. The survival and destruction of these mini-halos within the larger galactic halo are a major area of research.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Microlensing (Observable Contradiction):** While the overall NFW profile *fits* the rotation curve, the PBH mass must also simultaneously evade all other constraints. The most severe constraint comes from **microlensing**, which strongly limits the fraction of compact objects ($f_{\\text{PBH}}$) that can be in the range $10^{-7} M_\\odot$ to $10 M_\\odot$.\n",
    "    * **The Tautology:** If the rotation curve is successfully fit by the NFW profile, it implies $\\rho_{\\text{DM}}(r)$ is satisfied. For PBHs to be the DM, they must satisfy $n_{\\text{PBH}}(r) = \\rho_{\\text{NFW}}(r) / M_{\\text{PBH}}$. If the chosen $M_{\\text{PBH}}$ falls into a microlensing-constrained region, the model is **inconsistent**, even if the rotation curve is perfectly matched. This is why the **asteroid-mass window** is critical: it is the mass range that satisfies both the **cosmological evolution** (survival) and the **astrophysical NFW distribution** (rotation curve), while *simultaneously* evading the dominant small-scale constraints.\n",
